Project motivated by: My experience in an oncology clinic showed the importance of communicating schedule changes with the patient. When patients aren't notified of upcoming appointments or schedule changes, patients may miss important appointments, and in a situation where even one missed appointment significantly affected the efficacy of treatment, tech could be used to help bridge communication lapses. This is an example where a simple app made for the pt could be used to connect them with the details they need for appointment information and staying up to date with any appointment changes which could be made by the clinic (and it won't be needed to have admin try and reach out, sometimes unsuccessfully, to the pt about the appt change).
